    <p>During the initial stages of our senior project planning, we determined that our focus would be on exploring vulnerabilities and features of active directory. As a result, we began identifying the necessary prerequisites required to undertake this project successfully. It became clear that we would need to develop a range of computer networking skills, including but not limited to, understanding IP/MAC addresses, the TSI/OSI model, common port/protocols, and subnetting. Additionally, we decided that we would leverage Python and Linux as part of our project toolkit. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>November-December</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>At a certain point in our project planning, we shifted our focus towards exploring the fundamentals of ethical hacking. Specifically, we concentrated on understanding the key techniques of Reconnaissance, Scanning, and Gaining Access. To support this effort, we started working extensively with Kali Linux to develop our skills and deepen our familiarity with its various features and capabilities. During this period, we also successfully built an automatic ping sweeper, which was a key component of our project.
One of the challenges we faced during this phase was dealing with various technical issues, such as problems with Virtual Box, hardware issues, and network settings. Despite these challenges, we remained committed to our goals and worked hard throughout the semester to make good progress. By the end of the semester, we had achieved a significant amount of growth and learning in these areas.

  <div class="w3-container" id="packages" style="margin-top:75px">

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>After conducting a quick review of our project needs, we regrouped and got back on track after winter break. During this phase, we successfully completed the development of a port scanner and conducted thorough research on ethical hacking. We then focused on putting our newly acquired skills into practice by leveraging various tools and techniques.
For reconnaissance, we began using different tools to identify potential targets, including email discovery tools that could be used for phishing attacks. Additionally, we delved into the process of cracking hashes, which was a pivotal milestone in our project journey. At this point, we began demonstrating our abilities through live hacking demonstrations. We also leveraged the Kioptrix penetration and assessment environment to simulate various scenarios.
During this period, we also initiated the exploitation phase by researching various exploits. For instance, we utilized the Trans2open exploit, which exploits SMB via Metasploit, and OpenFuck, which abuses HTTP/HTTPS protocols (manual). We encountered some challenges, as some exploits were outdated, while others were more complex, requiring us to invest more time in studying them.
As part of our efforts to enhance our project capabilities, we acquired a Flipper Zero device, which we attempted to incorporate into our project. Overall, we made significant progress during this phase, building upon the foundation we had established earlier in the project. </p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>March-April</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>During the later stages of our project, we shifted our focus towards conducting more demos and exploring new research areas, such as Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions. As we continued to evolve and learn about new technologies, we adapted our project accordingly.

One key development during this period was the decision to build a website to showcase our work. We intended to use this website to highlight vulnerabilities in our site and demonstrate how individuals could secure their own websites against cyber threats. The primary goal of this initiative was to educate people on the potential vulnerabilities present in their sites and provide practical advice on how to mitigate these risks.

As we worked on this website, we continued to refine our project and explore new areas of interest. We remained dedicated to our goal of learning as much as possible about ethical hacking and using this knowledge to create tangible outcomes that would benefit others. Overall, this phase of our project was marked by significant progress and achievement, as we leveraged our growing knowledge of ethical hacking to create practical outcomes that had the potential to benefit others. </p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>During the final weeks of our project, we have primarily focused on completing the website, conducting final research, and conducting various attacks. With the introduction of Chat GPT, we directed our attention towards exploring how it could be leveraged to secure websites or showcase the vulnerabilities of a website. We are also interested in testing whether an AI could be used to hack a website.

We have begun the process of compiling our final report, creating the final presentation, and designing the poster. As we approach the end of this project, we reflect on the tremendous learning experience it has been and are excited to see the final outcome of our efforts.The final stretch! The last few weeks have been mostly dedicated to finishing the website, research, and all the attacks. And with the introduction of Chat GPT everything around us focused on that so we also decided to take part in that. Now, we are focusing on how to use Chat GPT to secure websites or show if an AI can be used to hack a website or showcase its vulnerabilities. We have also started to work on our final report, final presentation, as well as the poster. This project has been a great learning experience and we are excited to finish it! </p>
